description         Charm - the Cross-Platform Time Tracker
long_description    Charm is a program for OS X, Linux and Windows that helps to keep track of time. It is built around two major ideas - tasks and events. Tasks are the things time is spend on, repeatedly. For example, ironing laundry is a task. The laundry done for two hours on last Tuesday is an event in that task. When doing laundry multiple times, the events will be accumulated, and can later be printed in activity reports or weekly/monthly time sheets. So in case laundry would be done for three hours on Wednesday again, the activity report for the "Ironing Laundry" task would list the event on tuesday, the event on wednesday and a total of five hours.
